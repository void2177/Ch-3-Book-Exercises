## For exercise 1, there wasn't much way to deviate because it was asking us to
##investigate, not find a solution.

##For exercise 2, I definitely think I found an easier solution than the instructor. My code took
##only 3 lines of code, depending on how many lines of text you wanted. I can see how the
##instructor's code can be improved, mainly by reducing the complexity.

##For exercise 3, I really struggled with this and had to ask ChatGPT for help often. The
##instructor had a better script written for this, mine wasn't that good.

##For exercise 4, I thought the problem was relatively straightforward. I think it matches
##exercise 2, where the instructor's solution was unnecessarily complicated. It only took
##a couple lines of code for me personally.

##With exercise 5, I believe the instructor wrote this better. I kinda struggled with "for" loops,
##and so while I did complete exercise 5, there's one line in the output where it's
##grammatically incorrect, saying "bottles" instead of "bottle".

##With all solutions, I can't find a better solution other than the one that was arguably better.
##Neither could be made better than the superior solution already was.
